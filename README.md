# Statistical-Analysis-of-Signed-Double-Word-Integers

This program is quite detailed and performs various statistical calculations on a list of signed double-word integers. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Minimum Value Calculation: It finds the smallest value in the list.

Maximum Value Calculation: It finds the largest value in the list.

Estimated Median Calculation: It estimates the median value by taking the average of the middle two values if the list is sorted.

List Sum and Average Calculation: It calculates the sum of all values in the list and then calculates the average.

Count, Sum, and Average of Negative Numbers: It counts how many numbers in the list are negative, calculates their sum, and then their average.

Count, Sum, and Average of Numbers Divisible by Twelve: It counts how many numbers in the list are divisible by twelve, calculates their sum, and then their average.

The program is structured using assembly language, utilizing loops and conditional jumps to iterate through the list and perform the necessary calculations. It also handles special cases like dividing by zero or avoiding division when counts are zero. Finally, it exits the program after performing all calculations.
